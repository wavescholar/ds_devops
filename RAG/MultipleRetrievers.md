In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, using multiple retrievers involves careful orchestration to ensure optimal retrieval performance. Here's how it is typically handled:

**Retriever Diversity**: Different retrievers may be used based on their strengths. For instance, some retrievers might be optimized for dense embeddings (e.g., using neural networks like DPR), while others rely on sparse representations (e.g., TF-IDF or BM25). Combining these can improve recall and relevance.

**Parallel Retrieval**: Queries can be simultaneously sent to multiple retrievers. Their outputs are then combined, either by merging or ranking results, to ensure a diverse set of retrieved documents.

**Query Routing**: In some systems, a query classifier or router decides which retriever to use based on the query type. For example, dense retrievers might handle natural language queries, while sparse retrievers process keyword-heavy queries.

**Result Aggregation**: Results from multiple retrievers are consolidated. This can involve scoring mechanisms like reranking or fusion methods (e.g., reciprocal rank fusion) to blend outputs effectively.

**Hybrid Indexing**: A unified retriever can integrate both dense and sparse representations, enabling a single retriever to leverage the strengths of both methods.

**Feedback Loop**: Using user interactions, the system learns which retrievers or combinations yield the best results for specific contexts, refining performance over time. 

**Trade-offs**: Combining multiple retrievers can increase computational overhead. Balancing retrieval speed and accuracy is a critical consideration in multi-retriever RAG systems.
